# HighTechHackathon
Our submission for the High Tech Hackathon

We're aiming to make the process of finding rallies and protests about social justice issues in your area much easier by aggregating twitter posts (we plan on adding Instagram and Facebook posts in the future) that is likely talking about an upcoming protest or such event.

We hope that this project makes it more convenient for people who are interested in participating in social justice events so becoming a more responsible citizen of the world is easier.

This project was created for High Tech Hacks 2022!
